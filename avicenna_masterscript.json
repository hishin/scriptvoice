He was born around year 980 in a village near Bukhara, which is now in Uzbekistan. At the time it was the capital of a Persian dynasty, and an intellectually rich place to grow up.

His father was a governer and a scholar. Avicenna was a very gifted child. He claimed to have memorized the entire Quaran by the time he was 10 years old. He studied Aristotelian philosophy in his early years, and at the age of 16, he turned to medicine. 

When he was quite young, the Sultan of Bukhara got sick. The court physicians could not cure him, but Avicenna did cure him. As a reward he gained access to the royal library, which opened up all kinds of avenues for furthering his study. 

In addition to being extremly smart, he knew he was extermely smart.
