I’m actually here in Boston, at MIT.\nSo how did this little cardboard box make me feel like I was miles away from where I actually am? How did it create a virtual reality?\nIf you open this little box up, it looks pretty simple. There’s a place for my phone, which plays the video of the beach. The rest of it sort of looks of like glasses, with these 2 plastic lenses.\nNow it’s this little piece here that’s the first step to making me feel like I’m actually inside the video on my phone - \nit’s what creates 3D vision."
