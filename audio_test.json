As much as I wish I could say I’m enjoying a nice vacation here on the beach
I’m not. I’m actually here in Boston, at MIT.
So how did this little cardboard box make me feel like I was miles away from where I actually am? How did it create a virtual reality?
If you open this little box up, it looks pretty simple. There’s a place for my phone, which plays the video of the beach. The rest of it sort of looks like glasses, with these two plastic lenses.
Now it’s this little piece here that’s the first step to making me feel like I’m actually inside the video on my phone - 
it’s what creates three D vision.
